Simple Ruby on Rails API development class. Using MVC and Rails Faker to populate data into tables , i able to generate API that can insert and view data.
Besides that i learn how to use Postman to test API after it is being created. 

Do clone my repo and make pull request if you want to do so.

Do hook me up on my email ahmedmuaz0152@gmail.com for any questions. Any suggestion is highly appreciated. 

Happy coding!
